## Getting started

Your objective is to **develop two web components (Token and Tokenizer)** and **integrate them in an existing app** - the [SmartStore](https://ilhan007.github.io/ui5con-app/#/home) app, to give different characteristics to prodcuts.

The **`Token`** will represent the single product characteristic, while the **`Tokenizer`** will be the container for all Tokens, providing responsiveness.

- Token

- Tokenizer

The **`Token`** and **`Tokenizer`** will be used in the **`Tags`** column of the [SmartStore Inventory](https://ilhan007.github.io/ui5con-app/#/detail). With the Token and Tokenizer, we will implement "Edit" mode of the Table and allow users to edit the tags.
