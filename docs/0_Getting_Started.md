# Getting Started

## Objective

Your objective is to **develop two web components (Token and Tokenizer)** and **integrate them in an existing app** - the [SmartStore](https://ilhan007.github.io/ui5con-app/#/detail) app, to give different characteristics (tags) to products.

## Token

The **`Token`** will represent the single product characteristic

## Tokenizer

The **`Tokenizer`** will be the container for all Tokens, providing responsiveness.

## Usage

The **`Token`** and **`Tokenizer`** will be used in the **`Tags`** column of the [SmartStore Inventory](https://ilhan007.github.io/ui5con-app/#/detail).
The Token and Tokenizer will be used for implementing **`Edit`** mode to allow users removing the tags as shown below.
